We describe a new approach to localize faults in concurrent programs, which is based on bounded model checking and sequentialization techniques. The main novelty is the idea of reproducing a faulty behavior in a sequential version of the concurrent program. In order to pinpoint faulty lines, we analyze counterexamples generated by a model checker to the new instrumented sequential program and search for a diagnosis value, which corresponds to actual lines in the original program. This approach is useful to improve the debugging process for concurrent programs, since it tells which line should be corrected and what values lead to a successful execution. We implemented this approach as a code-to-code transformation from concurrent into non-deterministic sequential program, which is then used as an input to existing verification tools. Experimental results show that our approach is effective and it is capable of locating faults in most benchmarks we have used, extracted from the International Competition on Software Verification $2015$ suite.
